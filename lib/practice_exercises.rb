# Time Complexity: O(nÂ²)
  #We only go through the list once without an inner loop, so I thought it was O(n) at first.
  #But because I am including a 'delete_at' method, which I looked up the time complexity of and found O(n), I'm implementing another command for the algorithm to do, which is determined by O of n amount of times. 
  #Therefore I'm assuming it is O of n squared.
# Space Complexity: O(1)
